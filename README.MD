# Simple RESTFUL API(😊Node + Express + Anuglar 6 + MongoDB😊)
1. Install 😊Node(https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v8.11.0/)
2. Install 😊MongoDB.
3. Run 😊Node express server😊.
   * Go to 'server' folder and run 'npm install' command to install dependencies.
   * Run 'npm start' command to run express server.(win run using ⭐8080⭐ port)
4. Run 😊Angular😊 Application
   * Go to 'mainapp' folder and run 'ng serve' command to run Angular application.(win run using 4200 port)
5. We can see the Simple RESTFUL Application.
   * In your browser, you can see the site.(http://localhost:4200)


# Explain about 😊 project
1. Keep Track of your time. How long did it take you? 
   * It took 4hr 40 mins.
2. Did you enjoy this assignment? Why or Why not?     
   * Yes, I 😊enjoy😊 because I am ⭐well versed⭐ in RESTFUL API.
3. What would you do to improve this small application?
   * There are latitude and longitude data so we can use 😊google map😊 for show location to improve this application.
   * I have idea
4. How could our simple API be turned into something cool?
   - I built strutured REST APIs in node server.
     * main routes: 'server/routes/place.route.js'           -> RESTFUL API routing
     * controller:  'server/controller/place.controller.js'   -> RESTFUL API functions
     * model:       'server/model/place.model.js'            -> Use `places' mongoose model for RESTFUL API  
     * Added seed() function that insert seed data in mongoDB
   - I built Angular application with well documented code.

😊Thanks.😊
